My custom libraries and footprints for raspberry pi boards

In this repository I collect all my footprints and symbols that I created for different raspberry pi boards and devices.
Feel free to download and modify them to your needs.

If you think there is a mistake, please let me know, specifying exactly what you would like me to change.
If you need something specific, just let me know too. I will do my best to always improve.

Have fun!
